<h3 style="text-align:center;"><i>I am a QA Analyst for the Artificial intelligence department of Davita. I am also an undergraduate student at Penn State University, studying Computational Data Sciences.</i></h3>

<h2>Technical Skills</h2>

- I am most comfortable with Python (including many different packages such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, lightGBM, scikit-learn, PyTorch, PyArrow)
- I am experienced in SQL (Specifically Oracle and MySQL)
- I have experience with mongoDB, and am always open to learning more about other noSQL databases.
- I have learned R and can write code at the same level as I can in python.
- I have recently completed a basic project in java in school, but do not consider myself confident in my ability to code in java at the enterprise level.
- I exclusively use linux and bash, and am comfortable writing bash scripts. My company uses windows so I have learned a little bit, but I cannot utilize powershell nearly as comfortably as I can bash.
- I know a little html and markdown for text stylization, but am by no means a master in html.

<h2>What am I learning?</h2>

- I have started looking into the programming language Julia. I am interested in working in this language down the line, and I am interested in contributing to open source projects in the language eventually.

<h2>What Projects am I working on?</h2>

Despite respecting and using open-source software every day, I have yet to make any meaningful contributions to an open source project because of my busy schedule writing code for school and for work. My school projects are fairly cookie-cutter, and thus I have chosen not to include them in my repository unless I was actually proud of them at the time. If I didn't contribute to the structure and ideas of the project, then I will not include it in my portfolio with my name on it.

I plan on becoming a regular contributor to some smaller projects once I familiarize myself with the structure of the code and understand the current maintainers' stylistic and structural preferences when writing code.
