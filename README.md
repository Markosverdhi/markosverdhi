<h2>Technical Skills</h2>

- I am most comfortable with Python and its data science ecosystem
- I am experienced in SQL (Specifically Oracle and MySQL)
- I have experience with mongoDB, and am always open to learning more about other noSQL databases.
- I have learned R and can write code at the same level as I can in python.
- I am somewhat well-versed in Java, and am currently learning Julia.
- I am comfortable in all three major operating systems, with a heavy bias towards linux.
- I know a little html and markdown for text stylization, but am by no means a master in html.

<h2>What Projects am I working on?</h2>

I am currently in the process of two capstone projects, both wildly different and equally fun.

One of those projects is the repo NowYouSeaMe. It's a fork on a project called SeaThru, an implementation from 2019 of single-image dehazing software on underwater images. This is really cool and interesting technology which can help make it easier for scientists to discover underwater wildlife, and make it drastically easier for researchers to take underwater photos with cheaper camera setups.

The other project is called Poker440. This is an experiment in which my team and I are creating a sandbox environment for agents to play poker against one-another. Using reinforcement learning, these agents will eventually learn to play the game and face off against each other. We do not know what the results will end up looking like. We are hoping to see the organic manifestation of well-known poker concepts, but are equally interested in weird tactics that the computer may start to have success with.
