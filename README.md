# Markos Dhimiter Verdhi
 A cumulative documentation of the projects that I worked on or completed thus far.

I am a QA Analyst for the Artificial intelligence department of Davita. I am also an undergraduate student at Penn State University, studying Computational Data Sciences.

I am familiar with Python (including many different packages such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, lightGBM, scikit-learn, PyTorch, PyArrow, and more), and I am familiar with SQL (I am most comfortable with MySQL but also have some experience in Oracle, BigQuery and others).

I am currently working on an algorithmic trading project using Python, but I am considering rewriting what I already have in Julia and continuing in Julia instead. I have not made a decision yet, but I also plan on creating a User Interface in the form of a mobile app to make it easy for someone to regularly interact with their portfolio.

I am currently learning Julia, and I believe that it would be beneficial for me to write my trading algorithms in Julia rather than Python. I am looking to collaborate on Anything that can give me more exposure in the field of Data Science and Programming in general, but I would especially be interested in learning more about servers and the maintenance of automated servers.

I am looking for help with branching into full-stack development to broaden my horizons on what is possible. I know nothing about frontend design and would be interested in learning more about it.
